vlc_sync - a synchronizing video players for social video watching
------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Prerequisites ===

* This video player uses the VLC media player's library for playback,
  so you must have VLC installed for this player to work. 
  http://www.videolan.org

* Python 2.5+ with wxPython installed

=== Usage === 

Start a server:
	python sync.py serve <port>

Start a client on another machine:
	python sync.py connect <server> <port>

Load the same video on both computers.
Seeking, play and pause are sync'd.

=== TODO ===

* initial sync (must be done manually by seeking to start on either machine)

* keeping track of sync in general, perhaps compensating for connection lag 
  (could be done smoothly by setting the playback rate; yes, this is 
  supported by VLC).

* proper support for more than one client (client's actions are not echoed 
  back to other clients, only the server's actions are passed to everyone).
