vlc_sync - a synchronizing video player for social video watching
-----------------------------------------------------------------

=== Prerequisites ===

* This video player uses the VLC media player's library for playback,
  so you must have VLC installed for this player to work. 
  http://www.videolan.org
  vlc_sync was tested with VLC version 1.1.x on Windows and Linux.  

* Python 2.5+ with wxPython installed

=== Usage === 

Start a server:
	python sync.py serve <port>

Start one or more clients on remote machines:
	python sync.py connect <server> <port>

Load the same video on all computers.
Seek, play and pause are sync'd.

=== TODO ===

* keeping track of sync over time, perhaps compensating for connection lag 
  (could be done smoothly by setting the playback rate; yes, this is 
  supported by VLC).
