Synchronize video players for social video watching

Prerequisites:
* This video player is based on the VideoLAN media player. Install it first:
  http://www.videolan.org
* Python 2.5+ with wxPython installed

Start a server:
	python sync.py serve <port>

Start a client on another machine:
	python sync.py connect <server> <port>

Load the same video on both computers.
Seeking, play and pause are sync'd.

TODO:
* initial sync (must be done manually by seeking to start on either machine)
* keeping track of sync in general, perhaps compensating for connection lag (could be done smoothly by setting the playback rate; yes, this is supported by VLC).
* proper support for more than one client (client's actions are not echoed back to other clients, only the server's actions are passed to everyone).
